    "1. A `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` file which was provided directly by Udacity and downloaded directly into the working environment. \n",
    "2. An `image predictions.csv` file which is hosted on Udacity's servers and was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library. \n",
    "3. Twitter, using Python's Tweepy library to query the Twitter API for each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at the minimum. The tweet IDs in the `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` file were used for the query and the results were stored in a `tweet.json.txt` file\n",
